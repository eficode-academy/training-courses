# Lab Name
In this Lab, we'll talk about how to structure a Lab to make it easy for someone to learn from.

I try to present the information in Problem - Solution - Example format.

I generally break down labs into 20 minutes of material. I'll present on the topic for 5-10 minutes and then I'll have attendes run through the Lab on their own for 10-15 minutes.  
Afterwards, I'll present myself running through the lab, so that attendees can follow along and so that I can provide additional insights into the Solution / Example.

If I'm short on time or have some reason not to put the Problem and Solution information onto a github page, then I'll just have the Example on the githbub page and explain the Problem and Solution via slides.
Either way, the critical information is always being displayed in the proper order.

> **Note:** This is just my template for doing this. Sometimes it will be necessary to break this template up into separate sections, based on the size of each individual section. That's OK!  

## Problem

Maximizing engagement and learning is difficult.  

Luckily there are a few small tweaks to how presenters commonly present information that can make this process much simpler.
In fact, one of the big mistakes presenters make -- because they have so much knowledge on the subject -- is jumping right into a problem's solution or explaining a feature.

The problem with this is that you have to meet the audience we're they are at.  As the presenter, you have ton of knowledge around (and context for) the solution.  
But, the people that are attending your workshop? They come from wildly different work backgrounds.
In order to mitigate that, start by explaining the WHY the solution came to be, first. This gets everyone on the same page, so that maximal learning can take place.

Start with making sure your attendee's understand the Problem, before trying to provide a Solution for it.

> **Note:** Why should we start with a Problem?
>
> To educate the viewer. Stating the Problem clearly, sets the stage for the Solution we're providing, later. In order to persuade them to try our Solution, the viewer has has to understand what is being solved.
>
> Make sense? If not, no worries;
> I'll leave the explanation to a much smarter person:
>
> "Convincing others that a problem is significant is an essential step.
>
> When a problem appears insignificant, almost every solution will seem too expensive. But for a significant problem, there are usually many solutions of reasonable cost. When we disagree about whether to adopt a particular solution, we're often actually disagreeing about the significance of the problem being solved.
>
> The lesson here is that it is difficult but essential to describe the significance of a problem in a way that someone working in a different environment can understand.
>
> The clearest way to do that is by showing how the problem affects real programs and real production systems."

## Solution
Once we've set the stage, by introducing a Problem, we'll show the users a Solution to that problem.

## Example
Once the user has seen the Solution, we'll use a hands-on example to make it vivid and real.  

These are steps the user should be running on their own.  

Lab -> Presenting with Charisma
Problem -> Stage Fright.  It's hard to present well, because nerves make you clam up.
Solution -> Reframe anxiety as excitement, because physiologically they appear the same.
Example -> Step by step through an exercise for reframing anxiety as excitement.

# Wrap Up
In the wrap up, I'll put a small recap of what the attendee accomplished.  

Then I'll ask ask additional, bonus questions to check understanding.  
* How would you do X?
* Why did we do Y, in the example?

Finally, I'll leave a little information to lead the user towards whatever interesting topic they'll be learning in the next Lab.
