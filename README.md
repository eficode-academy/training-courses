# Course creation guide

Great, so you want to make some new material, that is fantastic!


This guide will help you create top notch material enabling your students to get the most out the training as well as keeping the same consistent structure for all our courses.


## Designing the course:

Start off by first get the overall design of the course done by asking yourself some questions:

What is the learning goals of the workshop?
What competences should the students get by attending this training?  

Make some bullet points stating concretely what they get out of this.

Prerequisites? Is there anything the students needs to know in advance? If you are teaching how to develop Gradle plugins, then a prerequisite could be to know a bit of groovy and the basics of Gradle.

Show the list to some of your colleagues that knows about the topic to know if this is the right scope for the training.

Refine this with the feedback you get back. This is your overall recipe for making the course so it’s important to get a good start.


## Prepare the material:

Start off by listing the concrete skills the students needs to practice.
For docker it could be `run` `ps` `build` etc.
List them and arrange them in the order that makes sense to get introduced to.

This will be your todo-list of working your way to version one of your course.

### The 30/70 rule
We strive for 30/70 division between normal teaching and interactive teaching.

**30 %** of the time is where the trainer has a slideshow and talk.
This is good to establish the vocabulary of the subject and the overview of what is going on.

**70 %** of the time we want the students to be engaged in `learning by doing`.

This can be either exercises, discussions in groups, reflection work. Whatever makes the most sense to do, the one thing that matters is that they do the work, not you!

###  Making the exercises:

This is where 70 % of the course should be at.

The exercises should be self contained, meaning that you can go through them without looking at the slides or getting instructions from the trainer.

> For inspiration, look at Kelsey Hightowers  [Kubernetes workshop repository](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/craft-kubernetes-workshop)

We want our exercises to tender both the slow and fast students.

Therefore for each subject under treatment, think about the minimal set of exercises a given person should be able to do.
That will be your baseline for the slow ones. Make sure that they are well structured and guided.

In order to cater for the fast students we want to have more exercises than what the best can accomplish within the given time frame of the course.
This will make sure that even the best of them maximize their learning potential.

Mark the "bonus" exercises as optional or stretch goals to make sure the slow students do not get too stressed about it.


### Making the slides:

> Remember, this should only take up approximately 30% of the course!

Begin by explaining them why this is the best thing ever:

Start off by talking about the problem. What is the problem, that this is the solution to?

Next, spark the students curiosity by showing what they will be able to achieve after the course for example by asking questions like
 _“couldn’t it be great if we could spin up our infrastructure in seconds rather than hours?”_
 or
_ “Think about how great it would be to be able to change your code without worrying about breaking the code”_

#### Notes:
Teach on many levels: Talk, do, reflect
Make the students: Listen, See, Do, Reflect
Continuously set achievable goals, quick wins and positive feedback.
Learning is social: Make them form groups and talk/collaborate with each others.
Repeat previously done tasks to make them remember what they already know.
Make sure to give them a place for feedback at the end of the course.
