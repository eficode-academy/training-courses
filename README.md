# Contribution guide

Welcome under the hood of Praqma Academy, glad to have you here!

**So what can i work on?**
We have a lot of things to do, but before plunging into one of the issues, head over to [Toggl](https://www.toggl.com/app/projects/1604223/list/clients/27778573/page/1) to see what we have stated as things to work on.

Usually we have both new courses under way as well as improvements to old ones.

If you want to know the priorities of the things right now, look at this [Waffle]() where all the repositories under Academy is collected.

If you already know

**I want to work on something that is not here**
Generally we want to make things done before opening up new things to work on. But if you think this is too important to wait for, then get in touch with either Mike or Sofus.

## Philosophy of our training
Look at [the campaign page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FBguFkS8Apj-z9gSlKR9EPOQ91To6JGP3P-o-19Hz4Q/edit) for Praqma Academy for the why and how of our training.   

## How to make edits and improvements to the existing.
Just go ahead take an issue and start ironing out a solution. If you are uncertain about your change just make a pull request on it, asking for a review by a colleague. If you do not know who to point to then ping Sofus or Mike.

## How to make new material
We have made a  [Course creation guide](course_template.md) that both have the requirements and templates for making a new course.
